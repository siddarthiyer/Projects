# Rubik's Cube Simulator using FPGA

In this project, we have designed and implemented a 3x3 Rubik's Cube Simulator using the FPGA and its associated NIOS-II microcontroller as a System-on-chip. It uses a keyboard peripheral to act as input to the Rubikâ€™s cube to rotate the entire cube and perform rotations on specific rows/columns of the tiles on the Cube. Using keyboard clicks, the Rubik's cube replicates various moves such as U, F, D, and R. The arrow keys are used to change the orientation of the cube / rotate the whole cube in the X, Y, Z dimensions, to view a new face of the cube. We employ the use of a VGA to display this Rubik's cube and its simulation in multiple forms. The VGA monitor displays a 3d perspective of the cube, as well as all six faces.
Other features include undo and reset.
